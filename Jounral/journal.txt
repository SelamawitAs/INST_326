For this week, I used AI to help me with my Week 1 Exercise. 
The focus was on basic programming concepts like variables, strings, arithmetic, and boolean expressions.
I asked AI to explain why `input()` prints the prompt on the screen, and it helped me understand that it is just waiting for user input.
I learned how to format titles and authors using f-strings with width specifiers so everything lines up neatly.
AI gave me clear examples and short explanations, but I still typed and ran the code myself in Jupyter Notebook to make sure I understood. This made the exercises easier and less confusing, while still giving me practice with the basics.
