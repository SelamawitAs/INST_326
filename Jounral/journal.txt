Week 1 
For this week, I used AI to help me with my Week 1 Exercise. 
The focus was on basic programming concepts like variables, strings, arithmetic, and boolean expressions.
I asked AI to explain why `input()` prints the prompt on the screen, and it helped me understand that it is just waiting for user input.
I learned how to format titles and authors using f-strings with width specifiers so everything lines up neatly. AI gave me clear examples and short explanations, but I still typed and ran the code myself in Jupyter Notebook to make sure I understood. 
This made the exercises easier and less confusing, while still giving me practice with the basics.

Week 2 
I asked AI about data visualization basics, since I wanted to understand how to display information more clearly.
AI explained how to take raw lists (like titles, authors, and availability) and turn them into more readable tables or charts. 
For example, it showed me how to count how many books were checked out and then create a simple bar chart.

Week 3 
This week I used AI to help me with my INST326 work on functions and modules. 
It explained why splitting code into modules makes programs easier to organize and avoid duplication.
I also used AI for my R script assignment. It showed me how to add group names, comments, and a conclusion so the file matches the rubric.

Week 4
For week 4, i used AI to help me with my INST326 class. I uploaded my week 4 leature notebook and asked AI to explain object-oriented programming,
like how to turn a backpack into a python class with attributes and methods. I also used AI to draft my discussion borad response and make it clearer.
For other class assignment, I would have the AI give me short answers to questions relating to men often calling themselves gamers and how the technology scetor can be more inclusive. 
Overall, I found the AI to simplify matters and allowed me to write in an essay manner. However, I had to re-edit the answer to fit my style. 

Week 5 
This week I turned to AI for my INST326 assignment. It was all about classes and that object-oriented programming stuff. I had it break down encapsulation versus inheritance with some basic examples. 
The short explanations and code snippets really cleared things up for me. Then there was checking my Python code for those little bugs. Like when that AssertionError popped up.
AI pointed out the issue in my preview method. It walked me through why the function wasnt returning what it should. And it showed the fix step by step. 
In my other class I got AI to sum up this reading on ethics in data analysis. Helped me redo my responses in plain words too. Made everything way easier to follow. 
All in all AI cut down the stress this week. It wasnt just handing over answers. You know it laid out the why behind stuff. So I actually picked up better coding and writing habits.

Week 6 
This week I benefit myself of AI's assistance in understanding object-oriented programming. It clarified the points of classes, objects, and methods and provided me with examples through simple code. 
I got to know constructors and the reason for using self in class methods. AI was also there for me to correct minor mistakes in my code and greatly facilitated my comprehension of encapsulation and inheritance. 
In general, the AI reduced my confusion regarding the subject and quickened my learning process.

Week 7 
During this week, I employed AI tools like ChatGPT to be my guide in comprehending error handling and testing concepts from the lectures.
From the topics like try/except blocks, custom exceptions, and unit testing with the unittest framework, I requested simple explanations.
AI helped me rewrite my class notes into clear summaries and short examples, like creating a ContainerTooLargeError class and testing it with assertRaises(). 
Using AI made it easier to connect coding practice with theory. I learned that writing tests isn’t just about finding bugs it also documents how my functions are supposed to behave.

Week 8 
During the past week, I employed AI to clarify inheritance concepts from my Week 8 class notes. It demonstrated that subclasses can reuse the properties and functions of the parent classes which is quite helpful and not tedious. 
Additionally, I learned how to use super() to invoke the parent's constructor while overlapped methods.
AI also was a great help in correcting a tiny mistake in my code when my child class was not displaying the parent's attributes correctly.
It revealed that the problem was due to my indentation being wrong and a method being misspelled. 
In general, AI made the whole process of learning inheritance very clear and it was a great help in connecting the theory with my code.
