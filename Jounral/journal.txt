Week 1 
For this week, I used AI to help me with my Week 1 Exercise. 
The focus was on basic programming concepts like variables, strings, arithmetic, and boolean expressions.
I asked AI to explain why `input()` prints the prompt on the screen, and it helped me understand that it is just waiting for user input.
I learned how to format titles and authors using f-strings with width specifiers so everything lines up neatly. AI gave me clear examples and short explanations, but I still typed and ran the code myself in Jupyter Notebook to make sure I understood. 
This made the exercises easier and less confusing, while still giving me practice with the basics.

Week 2 
I asked AI about data visualization basics, since I wanted to understand how to display information more clearly.
AI explained how to take raw lists (like titles, authors, and availability) and turn them into more readable tables or charts. 
For example, it showed me how to count how many books were checked out and then create a simple bar chart.

Week 3 
This week I used AI to help me with my INST326 work on functions and modules. 
It explained why splitting code into modules makes programs easier to organize and avoid duplication.
I also used AI for my R script assignment. It showed me how to add group names, comments, and a conclusion so the file matches the rubric.

Week 4
For week 4, i used AI to help me with my INST326 class. I uploaded my week 4 leature notebook and asked AI to explain object-oriented programming,
like how to turn a backpack into a python class with attributes and methods. I also used AI to draft my discussion borad response and make it clearer.
For other class assignment, I would have the AI give me short answers to questions relating to men often calling themselves gamers and how the technology scetor can be more inclusive. 
Overall, I found the AI to simplify matters and allowed me to write in an essay manner. However, I had to re-edit the answer to fit my style.
